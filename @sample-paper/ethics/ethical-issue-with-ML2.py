############# Question #############
# In many practical applications of artificial intelligence, it is possible for people to be harmed or even killed by a deployed AI system.
# Depending on the application, there can also be financial losses or damage to property.

# Suppose you are designing an autonomous robot to deliver medical supplies around a hospital building.
# The robot will share the corridors and lifts of the building with many other users (for example patients, medical staff, and trolleys).

# Identify one ethical and/or legal issue for delivery robots, and reflect critically on the following questions:
# 1, How important is the ethical and/or legal issue that you chose?
#    For example, could it prevent the deployment of an AI system, or cause significant harm or loss when an AI system is deployed?
# 2, Are there potential solutions to the ethical and/or legal issue? How plausible are the potential solutions?

# There is no need to include references in your answer.
# Your answer is limited to 250 words. Any part of your answer beyond the word limit will not be marked.


############# Answer1 #############
# A key ethical and legal issue in deploying autonomous medical delivery robots is accountability for errors, particularly when a robot malfunctions and causes harm such as delivering medication to the wrong patient, blocking emergency pathways, or colliding with hospital staff.
# This issue is critical because mistakes in a healthcare setting can lead to severe consequences, including patient injury, delayed treatment, or even loss of life.
# If responsibility is unclear whether it lies with the hospital, the AI developers, or the manufacturerâ€”legal disputes could arise, delaying the adoption of these robots.
# Additionally, regulatory bodies may hesitate to approve such systems if accountability is not well-defined.

# Potential solutions include transparent AI decision-making and human oversight mechanisms.
# Implementing real-time monitoring, automated logging of robot actions, and an AI explainability framework can improve traceability and help determine liability.
# Furthermore, introducing a fail-safe mechanism, such as requiring human verification for high-risk deliveries like controlled substances, can mitigate risks.
# Another approach is the legal classification of AI systems, where manufacturers and operators assume shared liability, ensuring accountability while maintaining innovation.
# These solutions are plausible but require regulatory adaptation, hospital workflow integration, and technical advancements in AI transparency.
# While ethical and legal challenges remain, structured governance and oversight can support the safe deployment of AI-driven medical delivery robots.
