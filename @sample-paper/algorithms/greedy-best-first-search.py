############# Question #############
# Consider the "greedy-best-first-search.png" map where each connection between two cities is labelled with the distance by road.
# The following table contains the distance by road between each pair of cities that are connected by a road:

# City 1       City 2       Distance by road
# ------------------------------------------
# Malton       Scarborough   17
# Thirsk       Malton        5
# York         Malton        12
# Pocklington  Malton        10
# Thirsk       York          6
# York         Pocklington   11
# Thirsk       Harrogate     12
# Harrogate    Leeds         10
# York         Leeds         16
# Pocklington  Wakefield     15
# Leeds        Wakefield     8

# In addition to the map and table above, the following table contains the Euclidean (straight line) distances from all other cities to Pocklington:

# City           Euclidean distance to Pocklington
# ----------------------------------------------
# Scarborough     19
# Malton          10
# York            8
# Thirsk          12
# Harrogate       20
# Leeds           17
# Wakefield       12

# This question is about applying the Graph Search version of Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) to find a path from Harrogate to Pocklington.
# One step of the algorithm consists of selecting a node from the frontier, potentially expanding it and adding any relevant child nodes to the frontier.
# The initial frontier will contain only Harrogate (H). Execute GBFS for 4 steps.
# For each step, specify which node is chosen to be expanded, and give the new frontier as a sequence of states (represented by letters) in alphabetical order.
# For example, W is expanded and the new frontier set is LP.

# <Step 1>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:

############# Answer #############
# <Step 1>
#   Node selected: H
#   New frontier: L, T
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected: T
#   New frontier: L, M, Y
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected: Y
#   New frontier: L, M, P
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected: P
#   New frontier: L, M, W

# Summary:
# 1. At each step, GBFS picks the node with the smallest straight-line distance to the goal (P).
# 2. Harrogateâ€™s neighbors (L, T) enter the frontier first.
# 3. Thirsk (h=12) is chosen before Leeds (h=17), leading to York (h=8), then Pocklington (h=0, goal).
# 4. Once Pocklington is expanded, its unvisited neighbor Wakefield (h=12) joins the frontier.

############# Question1 #############
# Consider the same map and graph structure as in the previous question, but ignore the road distances (treating each edge equally).
# We apply a simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from Harrogate (H) to find Pocklington (P).

# One step of BFS consists of:
#   1. Removing the front-most node from the queue (frontier).
#   2. Expanding it by adding its unvisited neighbors to the queue in alphabetical order.

# The initial frontier will contain only Harrogate (H).
# Execute BFS for 4 steps.
# For each step, specify which node is chosen (removed from the queue)
# And show the new frontier as a sequence of states in alphabetical order.

# ############# Answer1 #############
# <Step 1>
#   Node selected: H
#   New frontier: L, T
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected: L
#   New frontier: T, W, Y
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected: T
#   New frontier: M, W, Y
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected: M
#   New frontier: P, W, Y

# memo
# 1. both M and W are at depth 2 (directly connected to a node at depth 1, L and T respectively).
#    The frontier is sorted alphabetically, so M comes before W.
# 2. BFS is FIFO.
#    W was inserted into the queue before M (Step 2 vs. Step 3), so W gets expanded first.

# Summary of BFS:
# 1. BFS expands nodes in "layers," so each step removes the left-most node in the queue.
# 2. All unvisited neighbors of the selected node are added to the queue in alphabetical order.
# 3. This process continues until we reach the goal or exhaust the queue.

# Below is a BFS code example (using an unweighted adjacency list) that demonstrates this approach.
# The "queue" replaces the "priority queue" from GBFS.

############# Question2 #############
# Now let's restate Dijkstra's Algorithm question in the same "step-by-step" style:

# Considering actual road distances in the graph, we apply Dijkstra's Algorithm to find
# the shortest path from Harrogate (H) to Pocklington (P).

# One step of Dijkstra's Algorithm consists of:
#   1. Selecting the node with the smallest current distance from the start (in the frontier).
#   2. Expanding it by relaxing edges to its neighbors (i.e., checking if we can improve the distance to neighbor nodes).

# The initial frontier will contain only Harrogate (H) with distance 0.
# Execute Dijkstra for 4 expansions (steps). For each step, specify which node is chosen
# (the one with the smallest distance found so far) and show the new frontier (unsettled nodes)
# in an order sorted by their city codes (for demonstration purposes).

############# Answer2 #############
# <Step 1>
#   Node selected: H (distance so far: 0)
#   New frontier: L (10), T (12)
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected: L (distance so far: 10)
#   New frontier: T (12), W (18), Y (26)
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected: T (distance so far: 12)
#   New frontier: M (17), W (18), Y (18), Y (26)
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected: M (distance so far: 17)
#   New frontier: P (27), S (34), W (18), Y (18), Y (26)

# Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm will eventually produce the shortest total distance to P from H.
# Below is an illustrative code snippet that shows how we might track these expansions.
