############# Question #############
# Consider the "greedy-best-first-search.png" map where each connection between two cities is labelled with the distance by road.
# The following table contains the distance by road between each pair of cities that are connected by a road:

# City 1       City 2       Distance by road
# ------------------------------------------
# Malton       Scarborough   17
# Thirsk       Malton        5
# York         Malton        12
# Pocklington  Malton        10
# Thirsk       York          6
# York         Pocklington   11
# Thirsk       Harrogate     12
# Harrogate    Leeds         10
# York         Leeds         16
# Pocklington  Wakefield     15
# Leeds        Wakefield     8

# In addition to the map and table above, the following table contains the Euclidean (straight line) distances from all other cities to Pocklington:

# City           Euclidean distance to Pocklington
# ----------------------------------------------
# Scarborough     19
# Malton          10
# York            8
# Thirsk          12
# Harrogate       20
# Leeds           17
# Wakefield       12

# This question is about applying the Graph Search version of Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) to find a path from Harrogate to Pocklington.
# One step of the algorithm consists of selecting a node from the frontier, potentially expanding it and adding any relevant child nodes to the frontier.
# The initial frontier will contain only Harrogate (H). Execute GBFS for 4 steps.
# For each step, specify which node is chosen to be expanded, and give the new frontier as a sequence of states (represented by letters) in alphabetical order.
# For example, W is expanded and the new frontier set is LP.

# <Step 1>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected:
#   New frontier in alphabetical order:

############# Answer #############
# <Step 1>
#   Node selected: H
#   New frontier: L, T
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected: T
#   New frontier: L, M, Y
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected: Y
#   New frontier: L, M, P
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected: P
#   New frontier: L, M

# ** W is a new node, but the Graph Search version of GBFS considers whether the node is in the direction of approaching the target when adding a new node.

# Summary:
# 1. At each step, GBFS picks the node with the smallest straight-line distance to the goal (P).
# 2. Harrogateâ€™s neighbors (L, T) enter the frontier first.
# 3. Thirsk (h=12) is chosen before Leeds (h=17), leading to York (h=8), then Pocklington (h=0, goal).
# 4. Once Pocklington is expanded, its unvisited neighbor Wakefield (h=12) joins the frontier.

############# Question1 #############
# Consider the same map and graph structure as in the previous question, but ignore the road distances (treating each edge equally).
# We apply a simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from Harrogate (H) to find Pocklington (P).

# One step of BFS consists of:
#   1. Removing the front-most node from the queue (frontier).
#   2. Expanding it by adding its unvisited neighbors to the queue in alphabetical order.

# The initial frontier will contain only Harrogate (H).
# Execute BFS for 4 steps.
# For each step, specify which node is chosen (removed from the queue)
# And show the new frontier as a sequence of states in alphabetical order.

############# Answer1 #############
# <Step 1>
#   Node selected: H
#   New frontier: L, T
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected: L
#   New frontier: T, W, Y
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected: T
#   New frontier: M, W, Y
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected: M
#   New frontier: P, W, Y

# Summary of BFS:
# 1. BFS explores nodes level by level, using a FIFO queue
# 2. At each step, we:
#    - Remove the leftmost node from the queue
#    - Add all its unvisited neighbors in alphabetical order
# 3. Each node is visited exactly once
# 4. The frontier shows all discovered but unexpanded nodes


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
############# Question2 #############
# Consider the road distances in the graph. We apply Dijkstra's Algorithm to find
# the shortest path from Harrogate (H) to Pocklington (P).

# One step of Dijkstra's Algorithm consists of:
#   1. Selecting the node with the smallest current distance from the start (in the frontier).
#   2. Expanding it by relaxing edges to its neighbors (updating distances if shorter paths are found).

# The initial frontier will contain only Harrogate (H) with distance 0.
# Execute Dijkstra for 4 expansions (steps). For each step, specify which node is chosen
# and show the new frontier with their current shortest distances.

############# Answer2 #############
# <Step 1>
#   Node selected: H (distance: 0)
#   New frontier: L(10), T(12)
# <Step 2>
#   Node selected: L (distance: 10)
#   New frontier: T(12), W(18), Y(26)
# <Step 3>
#   Node selected: T (distance: 12)
#   New frontier: M(17), W(18), Y(18)
# <Step 4>
#   Node selected: M (distance: 17)
#   New frontier: P(27), S(34), W(18), Y(18)

# Summary of Dijkstra's Algorithm:
# 1. Always selects the unvisited node with smallest current distance
# 2. Updates distances through relaxation: if new_distance < current_distance
# 3. Each node maintains only its best known distance
# 4. The frontier contains discovered nodes with their current best distances
