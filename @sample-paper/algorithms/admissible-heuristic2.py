#    A ----- G
#       4

# - S → A costs 1
# - A → G costs 4
# - S → G directly costs 6 (not the best path)
# - The best path from S to G is S → A → G with a total cost of 5.

# - We define a heuristic h that is admissible (does not exceed the true cost),
#   but it violates the consistency condition.

#   Admissible means: h(node) <= actual_cost_to_goal(node).
# A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the true cost to the goal.
# - h(S) = 5, actual cost to G = 5  (OK)
# - h(A) = 3, actual cost to G = 4  (OK)
# - h(G) = 0, actual cost to G = 0  (OK)
# → heuristic is admissible.

#   Consistency means: h(n) <= cost(n, n') + h(n') for all edges (n -> n').
# 1. For S → A (cost = 1):
#    - h(S) = 5
#    - h(A) = 3
#    - Rule: h(S) ≤ c(S, A) + h(A)
#      → 5 ≤ 1 + 3
#      → 5 ≤ 4  (Wrong! Not consistent)

# 2. For A → G (cost = 4):
#    - h(A) = 3
#    - h(G) = 0
#    - Rule: h(A) ≤ c(A, G) + h(G)
#      → 3 ≤ 4 + 0
#      → 3 ≤ 4  (OK)
# Since S → A fails the consistency check, the heuristic is NOT consistent.

############# Question1 #############
# Suppose you are applying the *Tree Search* version of A* Search to a search problem.
# The heuristic you are using is *admissible*, meaning it never overestimates
# the true cost to reach the goal.
#
# Which of the following statements is guaranteed by using an admissible
# heuristic in *Tree Search A*?
#
# Group of answer choices:
# (1) All nodes expanded by the search algorithm will have the same value of f(n).
# (2) The first solution found is guaranteed to be the optimal solution.
# (3) The heuristic is also consistent.
# (4) None of the above.

############# Answer #############
"(2) The first solution found is guaranteed"

# < Difference between Tree Search and Graph Search >
# Tree Search:
#   - A state that has been visited once may be visited again on a “different path” (without a closed set). (It does not have a closed set.)
#   - Even a route that is not the shortest path can be re-searched, so a better solution may be found later.
#   - If there is an admissibility heuristic, the first solution found will be the optimal solution.
# Graph Search:
#   - Adds the visited node to the closed set so that the same node is not expanded twice.
#   - However, it is possible that a closed node is actually revisited with a better route. (In this case, the optimal solution may not be obtained.)
#   - Non-consistent heuristics may not yield an optimal solution.


# < Explanation >
# 1) Admissible Heuristic in Tree Search A*:
#    - In Tree Search, we do NOT maintain a "closed set" that would prevent
#      re-expanding a node. Instead, every time we discover a path to a node,
#      we add that path to the frontier.
#    - Because we never discard potential paths, we will always explore
#      the path that truly leads to the cheapest cost, provided our
#      heuristic never overestimates (i.e., is admissible).
#
# 2) Evaluating the Choices:
#    (1) "All nodes expanded have the same f(n)":
#        - The function f(n) = g(n) + h(n) will differ as soon as you have
#          different path costs g(n). Since there are typically multiple
#          ways to reach the same node at different costs, f(n) values
#          can vary. This is not guaranteed.
#
#    (2) "The first solution found is guaranteed to be optimal":
#        - In Tree Search A*, an admissible heuristic ensures that the first
#          time you pop the goal from the priority queue, it will be the
#          lowest-cost path. Because you do not discard alternative paths
#          prematurely, you won't miss any better route. Thus, this
#          statement is *true* under these conditions.
#
#    (3) "The heuristic is also consistent":
#        - Admissibility alone does not imply consistency. Consistency
#          (monotonicity) is a stronger condition. Hence, you cannot
#          conclude the heuristic is consistent just from it being admissible.

# Suppose you are running the Tree Search version of Greedy Best-First Search

# but might not be consistent. Also, there is no mechanism to avoid revisiting
# states (no "visited" check).

# Which of the following statements is guaranteed by using

# Group of answer choices:

############# Answer2 #############
"4) None of the above."

# 1) Situation:
#    - We use Tree Search with Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS).
#    - The heuristic is admissible but may not be consistent.
#    - No mechanism to avoid revisiting states (no visited set).
#
# 2) Analyzing Each Choice:
#    - (1) Consistency of the heuristic:
#      Admissibility alone does not imply consistency.
#      Consistency requires h(n) <= cost(n, n') + h(n') for all edges (n -> n').
#      Hence, we cannot claim consistency just because it's admissible.
#
#    - (2) Optimality of the first solution found:
#      Greedy Best-First Search prioritizes nodes with the smallest heuristic value h(n).
#      However, it ignores the actual cost so far, g(n). As a result, it might lead
#      to a path that seems promising by the heuristic but is not truly optimal.
#      Therefore, the first solution it finds is not guaranteed to be optimal.
#
#    - (3) Termination whenever the set of states is finite:
#      Because we're using Tree Search and have no visited check, the same states
#      can be re-generated infinitely (through different paths), potentially
#      causing an infinite loop, even in a finite state space. Hence, we cannot
#      guarantee termination.
