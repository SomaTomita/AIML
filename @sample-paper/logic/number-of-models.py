############# Question1 #############
# In propositional logic, if there are n proposition symbols, and one of the symbols is constrained to always be true, how many models are there?

############# Answer1 #############
# 2**(n-1)
# If one symbol is fixed as true, the remaining (n-1)symbols can take either true or false.
# For example, if n=5 and one symbol is always true, the number of models is: 16.


############# Question2 #############
# In propositional logic, suppose there are four proposition symbols A, B, C, D.
# How many models are there?

############# Answer2 #############
# 16 models.
# In propositional logic, each proposition symbol can take one of two truth values: true or false.
# If there are n  proposition symbols, the total number of models is 2**n
